# pr-pitch-writer

Writes pitch emails that journalists actually read. Different from press releases: pitches are personal, short, and earn the click. Built on AIDA adapted for media pitching and Ryan Holiday's journalist psychology.

## Frameworks

### AIDA adapted for media pitching

**ATTENTION (subject line)**: Journalists get 500+ pitches per week. The subject line is a headline, not a description. It must earn the open in a crowded inbox.

**INTEREST (first sentence)**: Why does this story matter to THIS journalist's readers? Not to you - to them. The first sentence is about the audience, not the sender.

**DESIRE (the angle / news peg)**: What makes this story surprising, timely, or uniquely valuable? The "news peg" - what it attaches to in the current conversation.

**ACTION (the ask)**: What you want them to do. Specific and easy. "Reply to this email if you'd like the data" beats "let me know if you're interested."

### Ryan Holiday's journalist psychology - "Trust Me I'm Lying"

1. **Traffic over truth**: Journalists need stories that get clicks for their audience. Ask: what would make their readers share this?
2. **Narrative over facts**: Facts support the narrative - the narrative is what gets coverage. Lead with the story angle, support with proof.
3. **Timeliness over importance**: Attach your story to what's already being covered. A story that taps a current conversation gets placed faster than a better story that doesn't.
4. **Effortlessness**: The scarce resource is journalist attention, not pitches. Make it trivially easy to say yes.
5. **Exclusivity**: "I'm offering this story to you first" changes the dynamic. Scarcity creates urgency even for journalists.

### Practical implications

**The "lazy journalist" test**: Could the journalist copy the pitch, add 2 hours of reporting, and have a publishable story? If yes, the pitch is doing its job. If they'd need to reconstruct the whole angle, make it easier.

**News peg identification**: What is happening RIGHT NOW that this story attaches to? A trend piece, a regulatory change, a competitor announcement, a viral conversation? A story without a peg is a press release dressed up as a pitch.

**Exclusivity language**: "First look," "embargo until [date]," "I'm only sending this to [N] reporters" are legitimate tools when true. Use them when you can. Never fake it.

## When to use

- "Pitch this story to <journalist>"
- "Write an email to a reporter at <publication>"
- "Get me on <podcast>"
- "Pitch <analyst> for a briefing"
- "Outreach to newsletter writer X"

## Outreach types this skill handles

| Type | Goal | Length | Hook style |
|---|---|---|---|
| **News pitch** (timely story) | Coverage in 1-2 weeks | 80-120 words | News value + exclusive offer |
| **Trend pitch** (you're the expert) | Quoted source for trend piece | 100-150 words | Data + POV |
| **Podcast pitch** | Booking | 100-180 words | Specific to host's recent episode |
| **Newsletter pitch** | Mention or feature | 60-100 words | Match their format |
| **Analyst briefing request** | Briefing slot | 100-150 words | New release + customer proof |
| **Customer story pitch** | Profile of a customer | 150-200 words | Outcome + access to interview |

## Inputs needed

- **Recipient**: name, publication, beat, recent piece they wrote (paste URL or summary)
- **Pitch type** (from table)
- **Story or angle**: what's newsworthy or interesting?
- **Proof**: data, customer, exclusive, expert availability
- **Why this person** (mandatory): why are they the right journalist/host for this?
- **What you're asking for**: 15-min interview, embargoed access, comment, podcast booking

## Process

1. **Load context.** Read `knowledge/brand/voice.md`, `knowledge/markets/positioning.md`, and any case studies that support the pitch.

2. **Research the recipient.** If the user provided a recent piece they wrote, read it (WebFetch). Otherwise, ask for one. The single biggest reason pitches fail: no evidence the sender knows what the journalist covers.

3. **Identify the news peg.** Answer:
   - What is happening in the world RIGHT NOW that this story connects to?
   - What trend, event, or conversation is this story an instance of?
   - If there is no news peg, the pitch needs one. Find or create the angle.

4. **Apply the "lazy journalist" test.** Map out the story:
   - What is the narrative (not the facts)?
   - What proof supports it (data, customer, expert)?
   - How much work does the journalist need to do to publish?
   - If the answer is more than 2-3 hours of reporting, simplify the angle or provide more of the work upfront.

5. **Identify angle from THEIR perspective.** Reframe:
   - Why does THEIR audience care? (not "why is this exciting for us")
   - What's the tension, controversy, or surprise?
   - What data or access can we offer that they can't get elsewhere?

6. **Write the pitch** applying AIDA line by line:

   ```
   Subject: <ATTENTION - under 60 chars, specific, not "Quick question" or "Following up">
   <The subject is a headline. It earns the open. It contains a number, a tension, or a specific claim.>

   Hi <First name>,

   <INTEREST - Line 1: specific reference to their recent work. Not flattery, but engagement.
   "Your piece on [topic] argued [X] - this is the counter-data.">

   <DESIRE - Line 2: the hook. The single most interesting fact. Often a number, exclusive, or contrarian claim.
   This is the news peg. It attaches to what they already care about.>

   <DESIRE - Line 3-4: the offer. What you can give them: data, customer, expert, embargo.
   Make it concrete. Apply exclusivity where true: "I'm offering this to you first before going wider.">

   <ACTION - Line 5: the ask. Specific. "15-min call this week?" not "Let me know if interested.">

   <Sign-off>
   <Sender name + role + company>
   <P.S.: optional, 1 line. Often the strongest hook moved here.>
   ```

7. **Subject line rules**:
   - Specific noun, not generic verb
   - Numbers if available ("47% of marketers..." beats "New marketing data")
   - No "Quick question", "Following up", "Touching base"
   - No clickbait - the email must deliver what the subject promised
   - Ask: would this subject line work as a headline for their publication?

8. **Length and pacing**:
   - 80-180 words total. Journalists scan, not read.
   - 5-7 sentences max
   - One paragraph is OK if the pitch is tight enough

9. **Voice rules**:
   - Conversational, not corporate
   - Match the journalist's beat. Tech reporter: tighter, faster. Trade pub: more context.
   - No jargon unless they use it
   - No marketing language ("revolutionary", "best-in-class", "unlock")
   - No em dashes
   - First person, present tense

10. **Self-check**:

    AIDA checks:
    - ATTENTION: does the subject line work as a headline for their publication?
    - INTEREST: does the first sentence prove you know their work and their readers?
    - DESIRE: is the news peg clear? Is exclusivity offered if available?
    - ACTION: is there exactly one ask, and is it easy to say yes to?

    Holiday psychology checks:
    - Traffic test: would their readers click and share this story?
    - Narrative test: is the story angle leading, not the facts?
    - Timeliness test: what is the news peg, and is it current?
    - Lazy journalist test: could they publish this with 2 hours of work?
    - Effortlessness: have you removed every friction point from saying yes?

    Format checks:
    - First line proves you know their work
    - Hook in the first 30 words
    - Specific ask, not vague
    - One CTA
    - No attachments (mention them, offer to send)
    - Subject line under 60 chars

11. **Save** to `output/pr-pitch/<DD-MM-YYYY>-<recipient-slug>.md` with frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    format: pr-pitch
    recipient: <name>
    publication: <publication>
    pitch-type: <type>
    news-peg: <one sentence>
    exclusivity: <yes|no>
    ask: <specific ask>
    lazy-journalist-test: <pass|needs work>
    created: DD-MM-YYYY
    sent: <pending|DD-MM-YYYY>
    ---
    ```

12. **Offer companion assets**:
    - Press release (if news pitch) via `/press-release-writer`
    - Background brief (1-pager) the journalist can use
    - 3 follow-up email templates (if no response after 4, 9, 14 days)
    - Talking points if a call is booked

## Pitch tracker

Maintain `output/pr-pitch/_tracker.md` (create if not exists):

```
# PR pitch tracker

| Date sent | Recipient | Pub | Pitch | News peg | Status | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DD-MM-YYYY | <name> | <pub> | <slug> | <peg> | sent | day +4 |
```

Update this every time a pitch goes out.

## Rules

- One pitch, one recipient. Never BCC. Never "Hi all."
- Specific reference to their work in line 1, or don't send.
- No news peg, no pitch. An undated story is a press release.
- Never overstate. If you say "exclusive," it must actually be exclusive.
- Never attach files in a cold pitch. Offer them.
- If the journalist doesn't reply, follow up at day 4 and day 9. After that, drop it.
- The lazy journalist test is non-negotiable. If the journalist has to construct the story from scratch, the pitch will be ignored.
- Keep the pitch tracker current. Tracking response rate is how this gets better over time.
